If, for example, the input is an image, the neural network will destruct the 2D structure into a 1-dimensional vector (by flattening the 2D matrix into a vector). To address the issue, we have Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They work exceptionally well for computer vision applications.\n","\n","Why do we use them when we process images? \n","\n","Because we know a priori that nearby pixels share similar characteristics and we want to take that into account by design. That assumption is called the **inductive bias**.\n","\n","> Convolutional layers exploit the **local** structure of the data.\n","\n","\n","![pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CUTe-EmbeddedAI/images/main/images/fig13.png)\n","\n","But how is it possible to focus on the local structure instead of fully connected layers that take linear combinations of the input?\n","\n","The answer is quite simple. We restrict the convolutional layer to operate on a local window called kernel. Then, we slide this window throughout the input image."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8o6zuJx5-lKf"},"source":["## Convolution\n","![convurl](https://149695847.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/conv-full-layer.gif \"conv\")\n","\n","The basic operation of CNNs is the convolution.

Note that each operation between the kernel and the image will be a dot product, which produces a scalar (shown in blue in the output).\n","\n","The output is called a **feature map**.\n","\n","We can see that given a matrix (our input) and a smaller weight matrix (**kernel**), we can produce a single scalar number. This number is essentially the result of the dot product between a small chunk of our input with the kernel.\n","\n","It is interesting to understand that this dot product is a measure of correlation (similarity). CNNs are great at learning the spatial correlations of neighboring pixels.\n","\n","Below is an example of a 3x3 chunk of the image (called patch) with a 3x3 kernel:\n","\n","\n","![pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CUTe-EmbeddedAI/images/main/images/fig16.PNG)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0vzKWkON-lKg"},"source":["Again, it is simply a dot-product.\n","\n","To recap: Given an input matrix N $\\times$ N and a kernel p $\\times$ p, where p<N:\n","\n","- We slide the filter across every possible position of the input matrix.\n","- At each position, we perform a dot-product operation and calculate a scalar.\n","- We gather all these scalar together to form the output, which is called the feature map.\n","\n","So what did we achieve here?\n","\n","**We transformed a 2D matrix from the input space to the feature space but without losing the 2D form of the input.
